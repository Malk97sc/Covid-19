# COVID-19 Analysis in Colombia

This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence course and focuses on analyzing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia.

The dataset used comes from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Worldometers, and is publicly available on Kaggle (the link is in data folder). Specifically, the file used is covid_19_clean_complete.csv, which contains daily reports by country from January to July 2020.
Objective

The main goal is to perform a regression analysis to predict the future number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia using historical data. Although the prediction focuses on confirmed cases, the notebook also explains how to adapt the analysis for other variables like deaths, recoveries, or active cases.
